# client clone

```
https://github.com/git-cloner/gitcache/releases 

Place the downloaded in a folder recognized by the command line. You can use cgit directly to accelerate, such as:
    Cgit clone https://github.com/gogs/gogs
    Cgit pull
If you need to submit, please change the remote "origin" project in .git / config to the original github.com URL

```
