# Gitclone.com

gitclone.com is a github.com cache acceleration website that accelerates the git clone operation from github by caching the frequently accessed github repository. When you clone therepository using git clone https://gitclone.com/github.com/yourrepository, gitclone.com will create a mirror, and when other developer clone in the future, then can use the mirror cache to make the clone. The speed has been greatly improved. Generally, git clone from github can only reach 20k / s. After accelerated by gitclone.com, it can reach 1.2M / s.

The working mechanism of gitclone is: when the developer first proxy the clone project through gitclone.com, gitclone.com mirrors the project asynchronously. When other developer clones the project in the future, it will use the local mirror of gitclone.com instead of Clone from github.com. gitclone.com will synchronize with github.com every night. In order to solve the growing demand for hard disk resources of mirrors, gitclone.com uses a blockchain cluster to expand. Each mirror operation will be broadcast to all servers in the cluster. Each server can choose to generate a mirror and register to respond to subsequent clones. request. At the same time, gitclone.com also explained the accelerated access of stackoverflow.com and go get, so as to "for developers".
